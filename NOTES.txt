	2.	Choose random titles from list
	3.	Query database for that title
	4.	Save as current animedle answer
	5.	Remove the title from the database

	If List.size() < X 
		query the top X anime again
		if query works
			clear database
			repopulate database with new data

Mechanics/UI:

	Search box using List<AniListTitle> retreived from database
	Searched anime(using AniListTitle.English/Native/Romaji) will be retreived from database

	if guess_category == daily_category THEN green mark
	if guess_category shares AT LEAST one element with daily_category THEN yellow mark
