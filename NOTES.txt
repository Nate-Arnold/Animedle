Backend/Database:

	Query the top X anime:
		X Pages
		Y Results per page
		FAVOURITES_DESC

		^^^^ Can only get 50 per page, so must make multiple API calls and update database with each call?

	Store in database of Anime objects

	Query random anime from the database every day
	Flag anime as USED so it cannot be used again until database reset
	If database.size() < A THEN query the top X anime again and repopulate database with the new top X

Mechanics/UI:

	Search box with all anime currently in the database
	Searched/Selected anime will be compared against the daily anime by categories

	Compare guess to daily by categories
	if guess_category == daily_category THEN green mark
	if guess_category shares AT LEAST one element with daily_category THEN yellow mark
	Else red mark

	Potential Categories: WIP

	User gets 10 Guesses
	User gets 1 hint at 5 lives that will give them the answer to a single category
